Entering Backend & Working with APIs

Today marks an exciting milestone — I officially stepped into the backend side of development and explored one of the most powerful concepts in modern software: APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

🔎 What I Worked On

🌦 Integrated the OpenWeather API to fetch live weather information.

🌍 Learned how to request real-time data for any city using API endpoints.

🧩 Parsed JSON responses to extract meaningful details such as:

Temperature

Humidity

Feels-like temperature

Weather conditions

⏰ Implemented timezone-based formatting to display date and time accurately.

🎨 Dynamically updated the UI based on the received API data, improving user experience.

💡 Key Learning

APIs act as a bridge between the frontend and backend, allowing applications to communicate with external services seamlessly.

Understanding how to:

fetch data,

validate responses,

handle errors, and

display results dynamically

is a major step toward becoming a full-stack developer. This hands-on experience helped me build confidence in connecting UI components with real-world data sources.
